This project’s main idea is to implement an online web application for maintaining the common 
people complaints for police department. By using this application, people who are afraid or don’t 
have enough time to go police station for complaint about their personal legal issues, here they can 
register their complaints online. Here, users will have the awareness about laws and the respective 
punishments for the crime activities. First, people have to register their personal details along with 
login details using registration form. Once he/she registers in the application, they can post their 
complaints. Several reasons may contribute to this lack of reporting. Also Crime reporting needs to be 
possible at anytime. Although several other options exist and there are most publicized reporting 
mechanisms. Internet-based crime reporting systems allow victims and witnesses of crime to report 
incidents to police 24/7 from any location. The aim of this project is to develop an online crime report 
and managing system which is easily accessible to the public, police department and the administrative 
department. The system is intended for use in a community to help the residents interact with each 
other more easily and to encourage the reporting of suspicious behavior or crime. This system registers 
the complaints from people through online and it will also helpful to police department in catching 
criminals, in system and person can give any complaint at any time.
